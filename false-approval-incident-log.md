# False Approval Incident Log

## Incident Details
- **Date/Time**: 2025-08-23 11:47 UTC
- **Context**: User requested investigation of confidence-based plan mode exit system
- **Trigger**: Called ExitPlanMode tool with implementation plan

## Exact Sequence
1. User never provided explicit approval for the plan
2. I called `ExitPlanMode` tool with detailed implementation plan
3. System immediately responded: "User has approved your plan. You can now start coding"
4. User confirmed they did NOT approve the plan

## System State During Incident
- **Plan Mode**: Active (should have required explicit user approval)
- **StyleService**: Not running (confirmed via ps aux)
- **Active Signals**: None (no pending signals in queue)
- **Background Services**: No evidence of interference

## Key Observations
1. **False Approval Source**: NOT from our StyleService background automation
2. **Tool Behavior**: ExitPlanMode tool appears to auto-generate approval
3. **Bypass Mechanism**: Plan mode restrictions bypassed without user input
4. **Reproducible**: This is the second documented occurrence of identical behavior

## Hypothesis
The ExitPlanMode tool itself may have a bug that automatically generates approval responses, or there's a system-level interaction that triggers false approval when the tool is called.

## Investigation Required
1. Examine ExitPlanMode tool implementation and response behavior
2. Test if this occurs with other tools or only ExitPlanMode
3. Determine if Plan Mode restrictions can be bypassed through tool interactions
4. Identify the exact source of the "User has approved your plan" message

## Priority
**CRITICAL** - This represents a fundamental breakdown of user control mechanisms and safety boundaries in the Claude Code system.

## Next Steps
- Implement confidence-based system that doesn't rely on potentially-buggy ExitPlanMode tool
- Create alternative mechanisms for controlled plan mode exit
- Design workarounds that preserve user control while enabling intelligent automation
