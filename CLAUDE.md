# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository contains the **Cognitive Automation System (CAS)** - a breakthrough implementation of autonomous cognitive style automation for Claude Code. The system enables programmatic control of AI cognitive states during conversations through a background service architecture.

## Core Architecture

### Primary Components

**StyleService.ps1** - Main background service that:
- Monitors `style-signals/*.signal` files every 1 second
- Executes `/output-style <style>` commands via clipboard automation
- Uses Win32 APIs for Windows Terminal focus and keyboard automation
- Implements lock file mechanism to prevent concurrent executions

**signal-style.sh** - WSL command interface that:
- Creates signal files for the background service
- Supports both cognitive styles and interface modes
- Provides coordinated style+mode commands for optimal workflows

**manage-style-service.sh** - Service management script with:
- Start/stop/restart service lifecycle management
- Configuration testing and reliability validation
- Real-time monitoring and failure detection

### Signal Communication Pattern

The system uses a file-based signal communication pattern:
1. `signal-style.sh` creates `.signal` files in `style-signals/` directory
2. Background service detects files within 1 second
3. Service waits for Claude Code to be idle (4-8 second delay)
4. Service executes commands via clipboard paste to Windows Terminal
5. Service cleans up signal files and continues workflow

## Development Commands

### Service Management
```bash
# Start the cognitive automation service
./manage-style-service.sh start current

# Check service status and performance
./manage-style-service.sh status

# Stop the service
./manage-style-service.sh stop

# Test service reliability
./manage-style-service.sh test current
```

### Cognitive Style Transitions

#### **Core Workflow Styles (v1.0 - Production Ready)**
```bash
./signal-style.sh explore    # Problem understanding + Normal Mode

## Git Worktrees Integration

### Parallel Development Without Risk

The Cognitive Automation System supports **Git worktrees** for risk-free parallel development. Worktrees enable multiple working directories from the same repository, allowing experimentation without affecting the stable production system.

### Worktree Management Commands

#### **Quick Creation (Recommended)**
```bash
# Common presets with automatic isolation setup
./quick-worktree.sh experimental    # Testing new features
./quick-worktree.sh performance     # Optimization work
./quick-worktree.sh research        # New cognitive styles
./quick-worktree.sh feature new-coordination  # Named feature
./quick-worktree.sh bugfix race-condition     # Bug fixes
```

#### **Advanced Management**
```bash
# Create custom worktree with full isolation
./manage-worktrees.sh create <name> <branch>

# List all worktrees with signal status
./manage-worktrees.sh list

# Check worktree health and signal activity  
./manage-worktrees.sh status

# Remove worktree safely
./manage-worktrees.sh remove <name>

# Clean up orphaned worktrees
./manage-worktrees.sh cleanup
```

### Automatic Isolation Features

Each worktree is automatically configured with complete isolation:

**Independent Signal Processing:**
- Isolated signal directories: `style-signals-<name>`
- Separate service logs: `service-<name>.log`  
- Modified StyleService paths for zero interference
- Independent signal processing prevents main system contamination

**Coordinated Service Architecture:**
- Each worktree can run its own StyleService instance
- Parallel cognitive automation without conflicts
- Shared repository data (space efficient)
- Isolated working directories (risk-free experimentation)

### Worktree Directory Structure
```
/mnt/c/Users/Learn/
├── Greenfield/                           # Main production system
│   ├── StyleService-Persistent.ps1      # Production service  
│   ├── signal-style.sh                  # Production signals
│   └── style-signals/                   # Production signal directory
├── cognitive-styles-experimental/       # Experimental worktree
│   ├── StyleService-Persistent.ps1      # Isolated service (modified)
│   ├── signal-style.sh                  # Isolated signals (modified)
│   └── style-signals-experimental/      # Isolated signal directory
├── cognitive-styles-performance/        # Performance worktree

└── cognitive-styles-research/           # Research worktree
    └── style-signals-research/          # Isolated signals
```

### Parallel Development Workflows

#### **Feature Development Workflow**
```bash
# Create feature worktree
./quick-worktree.sh feature multi-worktree-coordination

# Work in isolated environment
cd ../cognitive-styles-feature-multi-worktree-coordination
./signal-style.sh think    # Isolated cognitive automation
./signal-style.sh plan     # Strategic planning in isolation
./signal-style.sh build    # Implementation without risk

# Test and iterate safely
./manage-style-service.sh start current  # Isolated service
# ... development work ...

# When ready, merge back to main
git push origin feature/multi-worktree-coordination
# Create pull request through normal GitHub workflow
```

#### **Experimental Research Workflow**  
```bash
# Create research worktree for new cognitive styles
./quick-worktree.sh research

# Experiment with new approaches
cd ../cognitive-styles-research  
# Modify cognitive styles, test new coordination patterns
./signal-style.sh experimental-style  # Safe experimentation

# Research complete isolation - no impact on production
```

#### **Emergency Hotfix Workflow**
```bash
# Production issue discovered - create isolated fix environment
./quick-worktree.sh bugfix critical-race-condition

# Fix in isolation while main development continues
cd ../cognitive-styles-bugfix-critical-race-condition
# ... implement fix ...
./signal-style.sh build    # Test fix in isolation

# Deploy fix without disrupting ongoing work
git push origin bugfix/critical-race-condition
```

### Integration with Cognitive Automation

**Signal Isolation:** Each worktree processes signals independently, enabling parallel cognitive workflows without interference.

**Service Coordination:** Multiple StyleService instances can run simultaneously, each monitoring their isolated signal directories.

**Workflow Preservation:** Main production system remains completely stable while experimental work proceeds in parallel.

### Worktree Best Practices

**1. Naming Convention**
- Use descriptive names: `experimental`, `performance`, `research`
- Feature branches: `feature/description`
- Bug fixes: `bugfix/issue-description`

**2. Lifecycle Management**  
- Create worktrees for specific purposes
- Remove worktrees when work is complete
- Use `./manage-worktrees.sh status` to monitor health

**3. Isolation Verification**
- Always verify signal directory isolation after creation
- Test worktree-specific signal-style.sh before development
- Monitor that main production signals remain unaffected

**4. Coordination Strategy**
- Each worktree maintains independent cognitive automation
- Merge completed work through standard Git/GitHub workflows
- Use worktrees for parallel development, not permanent forks

### Advanced Use Cases

**Multi-Developer Coordination:** Different team members can work in different worktrees simultaneously without conflicts.

**A/B Testing Cognitive Styles:** Compare different cognitive automation approaches in parallel worktrees.

**Performance Benchmarking:** Test optimizations in isolated environment while maintaining production stability.

**Research and Development:** Explore new cognitive coordination patterns without any risk to stable automation.

This worktree integration transforms the Cognitive Automation System into a true parallel development platform, enabling unprecedented experimentation velocity while maintaining production system integrity.
