WHAT WE JUST FINISHED:
----------------------
- Created breakthrough ModularMOD-KnowledgeSystem.MOD documenting persistent intelligence
- Updated CognitiveStyleAutomation.MOD to v2.0.0 with all enhancements
- Successfully demonstrated our documentation output style
- Safely backed up all breakthroughs to GitHub

WHAT WE'RE NOT CURRENTLY WORKING ON:
------------------------------------
- No active development tasks in progress
- No specific implementation being built right now
- Just completed major documentation milestone

READY FOR NEXT PHASE:
---------------------
- All foundational systems are complete and working
